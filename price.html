                    <p>
                        Wrike has a variety of different options available to suit your team, including three types of user licenses – regular users, external users, and collaborators. For regular and external users, there is a charge per user. You’ll get 20 collaborator invites or 15% of your license count (whichever is greater) with no additional charge included with your subscription. If this is not enough, please speak with your Wrike representative to discuss other options.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Within these, there are full and guest licenses. A full license (regular users and external users) gives you access to every feature within your plan but external users are limited to certain access rights. However, a guest license (collaborators) only gives you some basic functions.

                        Wrike is an intuitive collaboration solution. However, aligning your entire team on a consistent way of working, configuring Wrike, and ensuring long-term adoption can be tricky. Our Professional Services team specializes in understanding and onboarding teams of all sizes, no matter their challenges. We recommend all new teams work with a consultant during onboarding, and insist that teams of 20+ utilize a guided deployment.
